# hello-world

Hi GitHub community!

Raven here. I discovered web development accidently in a computer applications 2 class I took in high school. By accidently I mean I expected it to be an in-depth continuation of my computer applications 1 class, where the teacher covered the keyboard so we couldn't see it and told to type a paragraph or two. Imagine my surprise when we started learning HTML. It was like I had discovered a whole new world. Unfortunately, after graduation I became discouraged and I lost focus with what I wanted to do with my life. It took me four years of indecision to circle back to web development. I'm just beginning my web development journey, so I don't know where I'll end up, but I'll tell you one thing I'm not stopping until I get to the top. Wherever that may be because I want to be the very best like no one ever was.
